					<h3>Big Horn Sheep</h3>
					<p>One of this park's main attractions is the Bighorn Sheep that come down from the mountains to water and graze. They have a RamCam to the park so you can enjoy the Bighorn Sheep from the comfort of your home. This lovely park is located in Hemenway Valley on Ville Drive with a fantastic view of Lake Mead.</p>

				<h3>Desert Bighorn Sheep History</h3>
				<p>For thousands of years desert bighorn sheep have played an important role in the lives of people in the Mojave desert. Native Americans hunted bighorn for food, hides, and horns, and in many areas petroglyphs depict these animals. Today the desert bighorn sheep is not only Nevada state mammal, but an extension of our local community and residence have grown to love them.</p>

				<h3>Repopulation</h3>
				<p>Since 1967, this herd has played a major role in the repopulation of the species throughout the state. Trapping and relocation is an important tool for maintaining healthy herd numbers and reestablishing herds in historic ranges. As a result of these location efforts NDOW has been able to increase sheep numbers in other areas of the state and helped other states do the same. The program has helped the states overall sheep population grow from less than 3,000 animals in 1967 to more than 12,000 sheep in 2021.</p>

				<h3>Icons of the West</h3>
				<p>These majestic and social sheep, which can live into their late teens, very in body and horn size. The males are called "rams", the females are called "ewes". Adult rams may weigh between 140 to 200 pounds, while the ewes may weigh about 90 to 150 pounds. By age 6, rams horns are big and extremely curved. Horn size helps to establish rank in the herd, the larger the horns, the higher the rank.</p>

				<h3>Facilities and Birds</h3>
				<p>As you can see from the picture, there is an adequate parking lot, playground, tennis courts, and covered picnic tables. The star of this park are the big horned sheep however there are a few trees and water so I expect some birds will be available if you come at the right time.</p>
